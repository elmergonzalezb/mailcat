mailcat -- Fake SMTP server that prints emails to stdout

Description
-----------

This program binds to port 25 by default (you may need to use sudo)
and streams to stdout all the incoming emails. If you want to run
it in a different port, pass the port number as the first argument.

Examples
--------

Print emails to stdout:

	$ sudo mailcat

Tell `mailcat` to bind to port 2525 instead:

	$ mailcat 2525

Run it in the background:

	$ mailcat &

Installation
------------

Grab `mailcat.c`, then run:

	$ make mailcat

Copy the executable anywhere in your path.
