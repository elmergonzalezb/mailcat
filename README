mt -- Mail tester daemon

Description
-----------

Fake SMTP server that prints emails to stdout.

It binds to port 25 by default, so probably you
will have to sudo it. If you want to run it in
a different port, pass the port number as the
first argument.

Examples
--------

Print emails to stdout:

	$ sudo mt

Tell `mt` to bind to port 2525 instead:

	$ mt 2525

Run it in the background:

	$ mt &

Installation
------------

Grab `mt.c`, then run:

	$ make mt

Copy the executable anywhere in your path.
